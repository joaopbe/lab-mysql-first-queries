**7. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 5. Give some insights.**
Most rated apps are most "known" very popular apps.

**8. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 6. Give some insights.**
Actually App Rating is integer so there are many apps with 5, list is not representative...

**9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?**
No common elements, as 6. is just a subset of best rated AppleStore

**10. How could you take the top 3 regarding the user ratings but also the number of votes?**
SELECT id, track_name, user_rating,rating_count_tot
FROM Apple
ORDER BY user_rating DESC,rating_count_tot DESC LIMIT 3;

**11. Does people care about the price?** Do some queries, comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion?
Users donÂ´t seem to care much about price when reviewing since avg price isince rates 0, 2, 3 have the lower price mean.
Review average does not vary much between free and expensive apps (around 3.7 vs 3.8-3.9 depending on threshold for expensive apps), so price is not a big factor.


## Deliverables
You need to submit a `.sql` file that includes the queries used to answer the questions above, as well as an `.md` file including your answers.
